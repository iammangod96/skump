An endless jumping game

We had built a 2d arcade endless jumping game with a twist that instead of a single player gameplay like "Doodle jump" we made a multiplayer game which gives you and even better gameplay experience with your family and friends. We developed an awesome algorithm for mouse interaction for one of the player, perfectly smooth and powerful.

As we started with this game only after the hackathon started, we tried to make it as fast as possible. So though the graphics are very primitive but the gameplay is good. Right now we made separate single and multiplayer games.

This game has a lot of potential and we will constantly improve upon it with better graphics, both multiplayer and single player incorporated into the same version, more power ups, more obstacles...
